# FlowForge AI
FlowForge AI is a consultancy that designs and implements AI-driven workflow automation for small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs). 
- Using no-code platforms like Zapier and AI chatbots like Landbot, we streamline repetitive tasks (e.g., customer follow-ups, inventory management), saving clients 10â€“20 hours weekly. 
- Targeting retail and healthcare SMEs, we address their lack of affordable AI expertise. 
- Our MVP, built in 3 days, automates e-commerce follow-up emails, proving our value. 
- With a $15B market and low startup costs ($5K), we aim for $300K revenue in 3 years, capturing 0.1% of the U.S. SME automation market.
